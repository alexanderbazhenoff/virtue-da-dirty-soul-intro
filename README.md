## TLDR

These sources are for Zilog Z80 Assembler in Alasm format. You should import and compile this source in
[Alasm](https://zxart.ee/rus/soft/tool/music/pro-tracker-alasm/qid:365628/) ZX-Spectrum assembler
[(I have used v5.08)](https://speccy.info/ALASM) to compile. Or convert this source manually for 
[SjASMPlus](http://speccy.info/SjASMPlus) which is cross-platform.

## Technical info

This intro was written by an hour or so with 'giga-screen' ZX-Spectrum effect usage, 25fps colour blinking that allows 
you to mix colour palette.

## Story

A short intro which was based on c-jeff's (now seajeff's) ideas then. Made specially for final version of the game which
was totally repacked and re-linked. I had to clear system variables and other useless data from the game code block, so
I run this game over 100 times those night. As the result I still remember every note from the music... Anyway 18 years
later I like this co-work, this prod looks good and fun enough.
